# Monica CRM / PRM

Monica is an open-source web application to organize the interactions with your loved ones. We call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Think of it as a CRM (a popular tool used by sales teams in the corporate world) for your friends or family.

## Customizations

This is adapted from the [official Docker Compose](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.

**Changes:**

- Set to local volumes (see why in the global [README.md](../README.md))
